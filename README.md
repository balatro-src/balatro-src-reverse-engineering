# Balatro Reverse Engineering Attempt

This project includes the Balatro Source Code with the Textures and Shaders included. Some things may not work.

## NOTE

This project was not designed as a way to pirate the game. It was made as an attempt to reverse engineer and learn about the code that was written, and as a result learning the Love2D framework. 

### Test Menu

 Balatro-OSS by default has the test menu enabled. To access it, simply hold tab when playing.

### "Compiling" Setup

### Step One
 Download LOVE2D at https://love2d.org

### Step Two
 Clone the project using Git:
  `git clone https://github.com/balatro-src/balatro-src-reverse-engineering`

### Step Three
 Copy the love.exe/love.AppImage file to the cloned folder, on Mac/if you installed it on linux, this is not required.

### Step Four
  Launch Balatro:

  ### Mac
    `cd <repo-dir>
    love .`
  
### Linux
`cd <repo-dir> &&
love .`

### Windows
`cd <repo-dir> &&
love.exe .`

This is a simple reverse engineering attempt of the game "Balatro", not some way to "pirate" the game. To actually play the game and support the devs, buy the game on Steam or other platforms such as Nintendo Switch, XBOX, Playstation 5 and Android or iOS. You can find it at https://playbalatro.com

However, if you want to support me for my work, you can do so by using the UPI framework.

I will make a ko-fi soon.

This will probably help the modding scene.
